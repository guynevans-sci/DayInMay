    "The easiest way to download Jupyter Notebook is through the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Simply follow the link, scroll down to the bottom of the page, click on the version most appropriate for you and your computer, and install. You will most likely want to download and install using the 64-Bit Graphical Installer.  \n",

    "**Note for Google Chromebook and other 'cloud-enabled' devices:**  \n",
    "Google Chromebooks and other 'cloud-enabled device' are not full-function laptops as they do not allow you to download and install programs. Please be aware that the university requires all students to obtain a full function laptop that is capable of downloading and installing programs. If this is an issue for you, please contact your instructor. Workarounds, such as the [online trial version of JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try) may be available.  \n",

    "**Note for Instructors:**  \n",
    "While most of this notebook is focused on performing specific tasks using Jupyter Notebook, it is important to remember that we are also using this program to teach students, either about Jupyter Notebook itself or (more likely) about the data we are trying to explore using this program. As such, I recommend that you also read the **pedagogocial notes** found at the bottom of this notebook. "

    "# 2. What is a \"Notebook\"?\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is a **computational notebook**. A computational notebook is designed to allow the user to present:  \n",
    "1. working computer code   \n",
    "2. text-based explanations of why and how that code is being used.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a Jupyter Notebook can be divided into:  \n",
    "1. **Code blocks**, which contain working computer code  \n",
    "2. **Markdown blocks**, which contain text-based explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1. Code Blocks\n",
    "Code blocks contain working computer code and are typically written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). As computer coding languages go, [Python](https://www.python.org/) is both extremely versitile and relatively straightforward. As such, it is a valuable skill to learn and very much accessible to non-programmers. Furthermore, there is an extensive user community out there. So, if you want to do someting in python or Jupyter Notebook, simply conduct an internet search for \"Python \\[thing you want to do\\]\" or  \"Jupyter \\[thing you want to do\\]\" and you will usually get an answer. Good answers often come from StackExchange, but other sites also have good answers sometimes and you may need to poke around a bit and try some stuff out before finding an appropriate answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To select a code block to run or edit code, simply click on the block. A green box will appear around the block, showing that it is selected. To edit, simply click on the place you wish to edit and start typing. To run, simply click **Run** in the toolbar at the top of the page. You can also run all blocks by clicking on the double arrows (the 'fast forward' icon) in the same toolbar. You can then click \"Restart and Run All Cells\". Below are some examples of simple Python code. Click **Run** at in the tool bar at the top of your screen to run the code block. Then, change some of the variables to see what happens."

    "### 2.2.1. Coding in Other Languages \n",
    "It is possible to set up a Jupyter Notebook to run languages other than Python (e.g., R, Fortran, MATLAB, C++, Stata, SQL, ...). This is done through various [Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels). Please note that you will need to have the other program installed and properly connected to the Jupyter Notebook environment for these kernals to work. This is clearly a more advanced technique and may be difficult for beginning users. So, if you are starting from scratch, it's probably best to just stick with Python. However, it's useful to know that other options are available, especially if you have inherited code from somewhere else (perhaps in a research context) that you want to run in the Jupyter Notebook environment"

    "# Appendix A. Pedagogical Notes\n",
    "Most students will not be familiar with computational data analysis or even working with computers more generally. In fact, the main point of this workshop is to encourage you to expand teaching of computational and data skills beyond where they have been traditionally taught with the goal of expanding the base of students competent in these skills. Because you are intentionally imersing students in an **unfamiliar pedagogical environment**, I strongly recommend pairing the introduction of Jupyter Notebook with the concepts of **Growth Mindset** and (pedagogical) **Transparency**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## A.1. Growth Mindset\n",
    "Briefly, a **\"growth mindset\"** is the psychological disposition (or belief) that learning fundamentally alters and improves one's abilities. Seen through this mindset, learning is not just the accumulation of new knowledge, but the directed development of new skills and new abilities. In other words, one does not simply learn \"more\", but also \"better\". Students with a growth mindset will be more willing to take on new and unfamiliar challenges and accept failures as learning opportunities rather than judgements.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"growth mindset\" is typically used in opposition to the term **\"fixed mindset\"**, which describes the psychological disposition (or belief) that one's fundamental abilities are fixed, and that learning does not fundamentally alter one's inherent (and probably inherited) abilities. Under a fixed mindset, it makes sense to focus on areas of past success and avoid areas of past failure. It does not make sense to \"waste\" effort trying to learn something currently unfamiliar or in which one has had previous unsuccessful experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, both the \"growth mindset\" and the \"fixed mindset\" are functional beliefs. This means that to receive the benefits of a growth mindset it is enough to accept the growth mindset concept as a plausible working hypothesis even as one may hold onto deeply held doubts and contradictory core beliefs. As instructors, **we can help students to develop growth mindsets** by:  \n",
    "* explicitly exposing them to the ideas of \"growth\" and \"fixed\" mindsets\n",
    "* ensuring that first-time failures are low stakes (ideally, no stakes)\n",
    "* providing concrete opportunities for meaningful corrections \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Jupyter Notebook, it is important that students understand it is okay to try something and fail as long as they learn from these failures and eventually succeed. This emphasis on dedicated practice and willingness to learn rather than first-time knowledge and familiarity with the program should be concretely reflected in the grading policy, for example by offering students multiple oppportunities to receive ungraded feedback and submit assignments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For more on the \"growth mindset\" and the opposing \"fixed mindset\", please see [Dweck, C. S. (2007) Mindset: The new psychology of success. Ballantine Books (ISBN 9780345472328).](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/44330/mindset-by-carol-s-dweck-phd/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## A.2. Transparency\n",
    "The vast majority of students will be unfamiliar with the Jupyter Notebook program and computational and data-oriented thinking generally. Therefore, it is important to provide them with explicit guidance and instruction on assignment expectations and available resources that can help them complete these assignments. The use of explicit instruction and guidance toward helpful resources in an effort to familiarize students with an otherwise unfamiliar learning environment is the basic concept behind pedagogical **transparency**, which has been demonstrated to help first-generation students adjust to the otherwise unfamiliar and disorienting college learning environment. Concretely, pedagogical transparency means providing explicit guidance about:\n",
    "* how to complete an assignment\n",
    "* when to complete various parts of the assignment (i.e., a detailed schedule)\n",
    "* an explanation of what one is supposed to learn in completing the assignment\n",
    "* why that information or skill is valuable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To help you integrate the concept of pedagogical transparency into your Jupyter Notebook assignment, I have provided a template **Assignment Overview** section for the assignment. As a matter of work process, I often find it easiest to develop this section last, once I have a clear idea of what the assignment actually includes and a clear head about what I am actually trying to teach.    \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find out more about Transparency in Learning and Teaching at the [TILT Higher Ed](https://tilthighered.com/) website.   "
